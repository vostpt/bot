# Installation
Before anything else, install the dependencies:
```sh
yarn install
```

or for those who prefer `npm`:
```sh
npm install
```

# Configuration
After installing the dependencies, it's time for a quick configuration.

Create a `.env` file in the project root.

```sh
cp .env.example .env
```

Execute Sequelize migrations:

`npx sequelize-cli db:migrate --env ENVIRONMENT`

ENVIRONMENT: development | test | production

If you went through the previous steps successfully, you should now be able to run **VOSTPT Discord bot** with the following command:

```sh
npm start
